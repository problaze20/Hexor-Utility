## Contributing

Hey there — thanks for checking out Hexor Utility and thinking about contributing!

Right now, we're not accepting direct contributions to the repo. It’s still early in development, and we want to keep things focused while we iron out core features and stability.

That said, you're totally welcome to:
- Fork the repo and build on it however you like
- Open issues for bugs or feature ideas — we do read them, even if we can’t respond right away

We’ll likely open contributions once things settle a bit. Stay tuned!
