## Contributing  

Thank you so much for showing interest in contributing to **Hexor Utility**! Your enthusiasm means a lot to us, and we're truly grateful for it.  

Currently, we're not actively accepting contributions. However, there are still ways you can engage with the project:  
- Feel free to **fork** the repository and use the code for your own projects.  
- Youâ€™re welcome to **open issues** to share feature suggestions or report any bugs you come across. While we may not be able to address them right away, your feedback is always valuable to us!  

If contributing is something you'd like to do in the future, stay tuned! As the project evolves, we might open up contributions down the line.
