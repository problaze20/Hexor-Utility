# Installation

1. **Download** the `.zip` file from [Releases](https://github.com/problaze20/Hexor-Utility/releases)

2. **Unzip** the downloaded `.zip` file.
   > Note:
   > Safari automatically unzips your files if the **Open "Safe" Files After Downloading** setting is enabled. If so, you can skip step 2.

3. **Important**:  
   macOS may block the app since it's unsigned.  
   You have two safe ways to open it:

   **Option 1: Right-click Method**  
   - **Right-click** (or **Control + Click**) on the app  
   - Select `Open`  
   - Then click `Open` again in the warning dialog

   **Option 2: From System Settings**  
   - Open `System Settings` → `Privacy & Security`  
   - Scroll down to the **Security** section  
   - You’ll see a message saying *“Hexor Utility was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.”*  
   - Click `Open Anyway`  
   - When prompted, confirm by selecting `Open`

4. (Optional) Drag **Hexor Utility.app** to your **Applications** folder for easy access.
